# MinecraftPI
An unmodified version of Minecraft PI Edition and it's API/data. All rights go to Mojang.

This version of the game never gets updated, and so I am archiving it here just in case we lose it.


# Instructions
On a raspberry pi 1/2 with Raspbian Wheezy or newer, make sure to have XWindows/X11 installed. Navigate to this folder in your terminal of choice.
Then run ./minecraftpi to launch the game.
